perhaps we should put f1 or f2 at the move when the u and x axes are moving so quickly (mostly u)
so that the feed rate keeps the machine from getting a joint following error.  that would help quite a bit doncha think?





Would it work to put 2 power supplies on the system such that the wire is under constant current, and the motor driver is setup for constant voltage.

also, what temperature do i need for the wire to cut the foam such that it does not stall with the motors driving.



we need to fix the way the foil is shifted up and down in the foam so that it stays within the params of the foil and the machine.





























































































make xy lists a single list of tuples

no need for each for loops
# make each set of points in the following manner: ie assume x is a list of pts
x2 = x[1:]
x1 = x[:-1]
dx = x2-x1
like so
then make the points for the bigger shape, then make a fish bone after this 
based on a new set of geometries for the indents changing width, dist and so on
#    x2 = x[1:]
#    x1 = x[:-1]
#    y2 = y[1:]
#    y1 = y[:-1]
#    
#    dx = x2 - x1
#    dy = y2 - y1
#    
#    dxt = dx[:len(dx)//2]
#    dxb = dx[len(dx)//2:]
#    dyt = dy[:len(dy)//2]
#    dyb = dy[len(dy)//2:]




The thicker the wire is, the less resistance it supplies...... we need a thinner wire
Maybe get a weigth to add to design so that it hold the wire taut


use partial functions: if certain values will not be used, call an easier function to use
